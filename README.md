## Inspiration 😤
Most of the time, I found myself looking for an activity to blow my steam off after coding. This is when I decided to create my own anime/manga recommendation app.


## Features and Functionality 🖥
1. Anime and Manga Recommendation (2-in-1) - Separate tabs for Anime and Manga
2. Search- User can search for anime and manga
3. 25 Most Popular Manga/Anime of All-Time- To help new reader/anime watcher to decide what to watch or read without regrets
4. Top 10 Characters of All Time
5. Recent Reviews- Accompanied with Scores of the following factors: Overall, Story, Animation, Sound, Character Development, and Art
6. Informative Entries- Each entry are fully detailed such as Original and Japanese Title, Ongoing Status, Author, Aired Date and most importantly Sypnosis.
7. Trailer
8. Main Characters- Additionally, each character's data can be seen as well.

## Project Experience 🛠
For this project, I used MyAnimeList API. Unfortunately, some anime entries does not have trailer.
To solve that problem, I used Youtube API and create a custom search query for each anime that has no trailer.
Actually, this is the first project where I used 2 APIs at the same time. I'm scared to mess things up but I somehow managed make this work.
